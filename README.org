#+TITLE: Stmessage.py

This a rewrite of [[https://github.com/Tanish2002/stmessage-tanish2002][stmessage]] in Python, I made this coz I was having issues in AwesomeWM.

** Requirements
You need to have python3-xlib installed, if you don't have it then install it using- 
#+begin_example
$ python3 -m pip install python3-xlib
#+end_example
** Usage
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ git clone https://github.com/Tanish2002/stmessage-py.git
$ cd stmessage-py
$ ./stmessage-py <targets>
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Cython 
I have included a binary in the cython folder if you don't want to install python3-xlib as a dependency, I have also included the source code so you can compile the binary yourself if you don't trust random binaries from Internet.
